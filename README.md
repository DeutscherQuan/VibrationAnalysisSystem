The objective of this project is to develop a vibration measurement device using the ESP32 microcontroller and the ADXL345 accelerometer sensor for the purpose of detecting and alerting machinery failures in industrial applications.

Example code:
* [BME280](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/humidity-sensors-bme280/) - Bosch Temperature, Humidity and Pressure Sensor.  
* [ADXL345](https://www.analog.com/en/products/adxl345.html) - Analog Devices 3-axis accelerometer.
